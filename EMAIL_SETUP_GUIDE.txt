3. **Added email endpoint** to server.js (`/send-welcome-email`)
4. **Updated SignUpForm.jsx** to call email API after successful registration
5. **Added email configuration** to .env file

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Set Up Gmail App Password

1. **Go to your Gmail account**: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** (required for app passwords)
3. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" and your device
   - Click "Generate"
   - Copy the 16-character password

### Step 2: Update .env File

Open `Backend/.env` and replace these values:

```env
EMAIL_USER=your-actual-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
```

**Example:**
```env
EMAIL_USER=dakshaa2025@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
```

### Step 3: Restart Backend Server

```powershell
cd Backend
npm start
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending?

1. **Check .env credentials**
   - Make sure EMAIL_USER is correct
   - Make sure EMAIL_PASSWORD is the App Password (not your regular password)

2. **Check console logs**
   - Backend console will show "Welcome email sent: <messageId>"
   - Or error message if failed

3. **Check spam folder**
   - First emails might go to spam

4. **Gmail Security**
   - Make sure "Less secure app access" is OFF (use App Password instead)
   - Make sure 2FA is enabled

### Common Errors:

**Error: Invalid login**
- Solution: Generate new App Password

**Error: Connection timeout**
- Solution: Check internet connection

**Error: Daily sending quota exceeded**
- Solution: Wait 24 hours (Gmail free limit: 500 emails/day)

## 🎨 Customize Email Template

To customize the welcome email, edit `Backend/emailService.js`:

```javascript
const getWelcomeEmailTemplate = (userName, userEmail) => {
  // Modify HTML template here
  // Change colors, text, links, etc.
}
```

## 📊 Email Statistics

Gmail free account limits:
- **500 emails per day**
- **99 recipients per email**

## 🚀 Going Live

For production:
1. Use a dedicated email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, Mailgun)
2. Set up proper DNS records (SPF, DKIM)
3. Use environment variables on hosting platform
4. Monitor email delivery rates

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

2. **Event registration emails** - Send confirmation when registering for events
3. **Password reset emails** - Allow users to reset password via email
4. **Event reminders** - Send reminders before events start
5. **Certificates** - Email certificates after event completion
