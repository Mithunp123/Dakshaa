3. **Keep steady distance** - about 30cm from camera
4. **Good lighting** - avoid direct sunlight on screen

### Typical Speed:
- **Good**: 1 student every 5-7 seconds
- **Great**: 1 student every 3-4 seconds

## 📝 Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Keep phone charged (bring power bank!)
- Test scanner before event starts
- Ask students to maximize brightness on their QR
- Take short breaks to rest your eyes

### ❌ DON'T:
- Let someone through if screen shows RED
- Override duplicate warnings
- Give phone to students
- Scan same person twice (even if they ask!)

---

## 🎓 Special Cases

### Case 1: Lunch Distribution
- Students can only scan **ONCE**
- If they scan twice → ORANGE screen appears
- Don't give extra meals!

### Case 2: Workshop Entry
- They need **workshop-specific** registration
- General entry ticket ≠ Workshop ticket
- If RED screen, send to registration desk

### Case 3: VIP/Guest
**If someone doesn't have a QR:**
1. Ask for ID proof
2. Note their details on paper
3. Contact coordinator for manual verification
4. Use **Manual Entry** if coordinator approves
