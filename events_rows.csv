problem, design an appropriate machine learning solution, and develop a working model within 
the given time. To enhance practical applicability, teams are also required to integrate their 
model with a functional web interface, simulating industry-level AI deployment. 

The event encourages collaborative teamwork, effective time management, and hands-
